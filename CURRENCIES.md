### ISO 4217

From Wikipedia:

>The ISO 4217 code list is used in banking and business globally. In many countries the ISO codes for the more common currencies are so well known publicly that exchange rates published in newspapers or posted in banks use only these to delineate the currencies, instead of translated currency names or ambiguous currency symbols. ISO 4217 codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price.

### Currency Data Model

|Field     |Type                            |Example|Description                                                         |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Code      |3-Letter Case-insensitive String|USD    |A unique code that identifies the currency                          |
|Number    |A 3-Digit Number                |840    |A unique code that identifies the currency                          |
|E/Fraction|An integer                      |2      |The number of digits typically displayed after the decimal separator|

Note that ISO 4217 standardizes _currency codes_ *not* _country codes_. Country codes are standardized by [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).

Country code and currency code must be separate fields in a database if both must be stored.

### A Few  Example Country and Currency Codes

| Country Name  | ISO 3166-1 Country Code for Stripe | ISO 4217 Currency Code |
|---------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| United States | US                                 | USD                    |
| Singapore     | SG                                 | SGD                    |
| Canada        | CA                                 | CAD                    |
| Japan         | JP                                 | JPY                    |
| Mexico        | MX                                 | MXN                    |

### JSON List of Currencies

After some research, I found this npm package, which provides a list of currencies and symbols in JSON. I like this one the best. It has regular downloads and multiple contributors.

If you're using this in the future, make sure that active contributions are still being made.

### Possible Model for Rendering Currencies

- Host a REST endpoint on your backend similar to `/api/currencies/:currencyCode`.
- Build a view component that accepts two parameters `currencyCode` and `currencyQuantity`. Alternatively, you could have a `price` type with those two fields.

The view component is responsible for loading metadata about the currency code and using it to render `currencyQuantity` as the proper quantity.

This approach drastically reduces the overhead on the frontend. It doesn't need to store a currency database. However, it requires an easily-cached REST request every time you render a currency.

### Professional Expertise

I always recommend having a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) review the flow of funds through any payment procession system before going live. Small mistakes in payment processing can create huge liabilities for a business. This is especially important for platform-type projects.
